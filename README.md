# 👨🏿‍💻 Dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles repository! These are the configuration files I use to set up my development environment. They include customizations for:
- 🔧 Shell (Bash, Zsh)
- 📝 Editor (VSCode, Vim, etc.)
- 🎯 Git
- 🖥️ Aliases & functions
- 🔌 Other utility tools

## 🖥️ Installation

## 🎲 Customizing
